# BMICALCULATOR-OIBSIP-
This project was given my Oasis Infobyte where I am doing internship in Python Programming. 
This is a project on BMI calculator (Body Mass Index).It calculates the BMI of a person based on their height and weight. It helps the user to understand whether they are underweight, healthy or overweight.
