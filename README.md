# BMICALCULATOR-OIBSIP-
This project was given my Oasis Infobyte where I am doing internship in Python Programming.  This is a project on BMI calculator. It Calculator calculates the BMI of a person based on their height and weight.  It helps the user to understand whether they are underweight, healthy or overweight. In this project I used python programming language.
